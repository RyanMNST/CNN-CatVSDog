## _Dog and Cat Image Classification Using a Convolutional Neural Network_
A project for the course CS 9342 Artificial Neural Network. This project deals with investigating a chosen classification problem and creating an artificial neural network model to solve it.

## Tools and Libraries
- [Jupyter Notebook] - Used to write the code and markdowns for the project
- [NumPy] - General mathematical library for Python
- [Pandas] - Another general mathematical library for Python
- [Matplotlib] - A data visualization library
- [scikit-learn] - A general machine learning library
- [Keras] - A neural network focused library used to train deep neural networks
- [TensorFlow] - Another neural network library for Python

## Files and Folders
- Model_Notebook.ipynb - Contains the code for preprocessing and building the model
- dogs-vs-cats - Contains the dataset used
