# CS 9342 - Course Project

## _Dog and Cat Image Classification Using a Convolutional Neural Network_
A project for the course CS 9342 Artificial Neural Network. This project deals with investigating a chosen classification problem and creating an artificial neural network model to solve it.

## Tools and Libraries
- [Jupyter Notebook] - Used to write the code and markdowns for the project
- [NumPy] - General mathematical library for Python
- [Pandas] - Another general mathematical library for Python
- [Matplotlib] - A data visualization library
- [scikit-learn] - A general machine learning library
- [Keras] - A neural network focused library used to train deep neural networks
- [TensorFlow] - Another neural network library for Python

## Files and Folders
- Files
   - Model_Training.ipynb - Contains the code for preprocessing and building the model
   - Model_Evaluation.ipynb - Contains the evaluation of the fitted model using a testing dataset
   - model.h5 - Contains the architecture of the model using Keras' save function
- Folders
   - results - Contains the results of model fitting and the evaluation of the model
   - weights - Contains the weights resulting from model fitting
- Downloadable (limited by file size limit in GitHub)
   - dogs-vs-cats - Contains the dataset used
      - Download the [Dataset] (1 GB).
